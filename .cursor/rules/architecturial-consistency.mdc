Architectural Consistency Rule

## Overview
Maintain a consistent architectural pattern throughout the project to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.

## Guidelines
1. Follow the established architectural pattern (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.)
2. Keep business logic separate from UI components
3. Maintain clear separation of concerns between layers
4. Follow dependency injection principles where appropriate
5. Implement interfaces/abstractions for loosely coupled components

## Examples
- UI components should only contain presentation logic
- Data access should be isolated in dedicated repositories/services
- Business rules belong in domain/service layers
- Configuration should be separate from implementation

## Application
- Before adding a new component, identify its architectural role
- When modifying existing code, preserve its architectural intent
- Don't break the current folder structure; if changes are needed, consult with team members first

## Enforcement
- Perform architecture reviews during code reviews
- Use static analysis tools to validate architectural boundaries
- Document architectural decisions for future reference
